In this repository we consider a set of notebooks introducing the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) from its very foundations. I intend to continuously update this repository with progressively-advancing tutorials.

All the notebooks are already implemented with the latest version of qiskit (2024) and their contents, for now, are:

### A beginner-friendly implementation of the VQE with qiskit 1.0 (Part 1)
  Here we implement the VQE to find the ground state of the Hamiltonian H = Z.
### A beginner-friendly implementation of the VQE with qiskit 1.0 (Part 2)
  Here we implement the VQE to find the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian H = Z - X.
